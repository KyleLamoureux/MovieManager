# Movie Manager
Temp name for now as I wasn't sure what I'd wanna call it

- Goal is instead of keeping track of all the movies I watch on my phone in notepad or what I used to do by on the computer where it crashed and I lost over 2 years of past movie watching's :(. I'm going to create this program that will allow me to do everything on google sheets.
- I want this is make it very easy to add and query the sheets to pull out information along with sort it the whole shebang.
- I'd also like to make it so I can update it from my phone. I'm thinking right now having me email myself with the new movie/movies I've watched and it will periodicly search my inbox for new messages and add the data to my google sheets

- I have taken my current movies watch this year list off my phone and converted it to JSON format.
- Now once its in JSON I'm going to get it to fill in the spread sheet

- It's running slow. Almost certainly because of the requests its making. Idea to speed it up: get the sheet and cache it so all the operations are done on it and I only interact with the real one if I have to.

### Can sort by:
- Date: ascending/descending

Most annoyingly none of the packages I've looked into do what I want or work... So do it the good ol fashion way
